Cooking Recipie
---------------

**Ingredients:**

-   2 level cups fresh blackberries
-   2 tablespoons honey
-   1/2 lemon
-   1/2 cup water
-   1/2 cup granulated sugar
-   1 1/2 cups plain unsweetened Greek-style yogurt

**Special Kitchen Ingredients:**

-   popsicle molds

#### Steps:

1.  Cut berries in half, place in bowl, squeeze 1 tablespoon lemon juice over. Add honey, stir to combine. Set aside.
2.  Place lemon peel, water and sugar in a saucepan. Cook, stirring, until it comes to a boil and sugar has dissolved. Gently simmer for 5 minutes more. Strain out peel and chill syrup completely.
3.  Whisk yogurt and chilled syrup together.
4.  Place the berry mixture in a blender and whirl until desired texture. Assemble popsicles by alternating pouring a little of the yogurt mixture, then a little of the berry mixture into each popsicle mold until you reach 1/4-inch from the tops. Use a skewer to lightly swirl the mixtures together.
5.  Snap on the lid on the mold and freeze until solid, 3 to 4 hours.

**Great recipie during summer months!**

*Feel free to use any kind of berries, not just blackberries!*

Euclidean Distance
------------------

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment conecting them $(\\overline{pq})$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula.

$d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q}) = d(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + ... + (q\_n - p\_n)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i = 1}^{n}{(q\_i - p\_i)}^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean Vector. So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (inital point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\\parallel\\mathbf{p}\\parallel = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}}$,

where the last expression involves the dot product.
