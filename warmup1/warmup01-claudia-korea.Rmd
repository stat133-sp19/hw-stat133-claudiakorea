##Cooking Recipie
__Ingredients:__

- 2 level cups fresh blackberries
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1/2 lemon
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 cups plain unsweetened Greek-style yogurt


__Special Kitchen Ingredients:__

- popsicle molds


####Steps:

1. Cut berries in half, place in bowl, squeeze 1 tablespoon lemon juice over. Add honey, stir to combine. Set aside.
2. Place lemon peel, water and sugar in a saucepan. Cook, stirring, until it comes to a boil and sugar has dissolved. Gently simmer for 5 minutes more. Strain out peel and chill syrup completely.
3. Whisk yogurt and chilled syrup together.
4. Place the berry mixture in a blender and whirl until desired texture. Assemble popsicles by alternating pouring a little of the yogurt mixture, then a little of the berry mixture into each popsicle mold until you reach 1/4-inch from the tops. Use a skewer to lightly swirl the mixtures together.
5. Snap on the lid on the mold and freeze until solid, 3 to 4 hours.

**Great recipie during summer months!**


*Feel free to use any kind of berries, not just blackberries!*

## Euclidean Distance


###Definition

------

The __Euclidean distance__ between points __p__ and __q__ is the length of the line segment conecting them $(\overline{pq})$. 

In Cartesian coordinates, if $\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2,...,p_n)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (q_1, q_2,...,q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from __q__ to __p__ is given by the Pythagorean formula.

$d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}) = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + ... + (q_n - p_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(q_i - p_i)}^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean $n$-space is a Euclidean Vector. So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (inital point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or __Euclidean length__, or __magnitude__ of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\parallel\mathbf{p}\parallel = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p}}$,


where the last expression involves the dot product.
